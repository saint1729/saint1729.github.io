---

Welcome to my learning journey through **Agentic Design Patterns**. This collection documents key patterns and best practices for building AI agents, complete with implementations across multiple frameworks.

## About This Learning Journey

As I explore the world of AI agents, I'm documenting each design pattern with:
- **Detailed explanations** of the pattern and when to use it
- **Code implementations** in multiple frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, Google ADK)
- **Practical examples** and use cases
- **Best practices** learned along the way

## Explore the Chapters

Visit the [Agentic Design Patterns Book](/blog/agentic-design-patterns/) to explore all chapters with detailed lessons and code examples.

Each chapter dives deep into a specific pattern:
- **Prompt Chaining**: Breaking complex tasks into sequential steps
- **Routing**: Directing requests to specialized agents
- **Parallelization**: Running multiple operations concurrently
- **Reflection**: Self-evaluation and improvement loops
- **Tool Use**: Integrating external tools and APIs
- **Planning**: Multi-step reasoning and execution
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Coordinating multiple specialized agents

## Repository

All code and content is maintained in the [agentic-design-patterns](https://github.com/saint1729/agentic-design-patterns) GitHub repository.

## Stay Updated

This is an ongoing learning project. New chapters and examples are added regularly as I continue exploring agentic AI patterns.
